# cooking-with-jenkins cookbook

This cookbook is a trimmed down version of the original cooking-with-jenkins 
cookbook for use in a CI pipeline for Chef cookbook development.  See
[the accompanying blog post](http://www.cryptocracy.com/blog/2014/01/03/cooking-with-jenkins-test-kitchen-and-docker/)
for details and commentary.

We're only interested in using the cookbook_ci definition and the supporting 
template, so this fork only maintains those aspects.
